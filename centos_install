[Installing CentOS6.9 on mac mini]
# See
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/ja-JP/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Installation_Guide/s2-diskpartrecommend-x86.html

# Hint
- Recommend that you use  more than two USB flash disks.
  One for CentOS disk image, and another for GRUB install disk or Ubuntu liveUSB.

- You may become not able to boot CentOS.
  Then, try installing GRUB2 form USB install disk.

- CentOS liveUSB may not work. Ubuntu one is much safer.

# Trouble shooting
## What sould I do when I see GRUB prompt?
If it's GRUB2, follwing enables you to boot OS.
1. Find the boot partition.
   You can see the content of parition by typing:
       ls (hd0,*)/
       (* is partition number)
    [If you cannot read it, reinstall rEFIt.]
2. set root=(ad0,*)
   (* is the partition number of the boot partition)
3. linux /vml... root=(dev/sda@)
   [You can complete ... part by press TAB key.]
   [@ is the partition number of system root, which does not have to coinside with that of boot partition.]
4. initrd /init... (TAB completion)
5. boot

## Cannot run yum
1. edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scipts/ifcfg-eth0
     ONBOOT=no -> yes
2. reboot
