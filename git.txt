################ About branch ################
[Why use branch?]
To prevent the confliction of commit.
Suppose two people, say A and B, are both working with branch master.
A made a commit in his local repository:
  C0<-C1.
And he pushed his commit to the remote branch.
B also made a commit in his local repository:
  C0<-C1'.
But this time, he cannot push his commit to the remote branch.
Since branch master is a single branch, it cannot split into two branches.
If you want to do this, you need to have created a new branch from master beforehand.
Now that they have reached this point, they cannot merge their commits.
When you have pushed your commit to the remote branch, your local branch must be completely same as the remote one.
However, now their remote master branch is like 
  C0<-C1.
Even if you simply add the commit C1' after this like:
  C0<-C1<-C1',
this is not equal to B's local branch.
This is conflict between commits.
