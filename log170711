problem:
1. see error messeage when PC booted:
Error activating XKB configuration.
It can happen under various circumstances:
- a bug in libxklavier library
- a bug in X server (xkbcomp, xmodmap utilities)
- X server with incompatible libxkbfile implementation

X server version data:
The X.Org Foundation
10400090

If you report this situation as a bug, please include:
- The result of xprop -root | grep XKB
- The result of gconftool-2 -R /desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard/kbd

-> fixed by typing
         sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg


2. keyboard layout is us when PC booted
->fixed by changing the line in /etc/default/keyboard as
        XKBLAYOUT="mykeymaps"
                        -> "jp"

3. the keymap settings of .Xmodmap doesn't be enabled when boot.
