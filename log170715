I tried to fix the keymap problem after start X, but finally I couldn't.

I tried:
-install fcitx-config-gtk
-reinstall fcitx
-change input method to ibus
-add "fcitx -r" to .xsession and others
-add "xmodmap $HOME/.Xmodmap" to .xinputrc
-delete /etc/default/keyboard
  -> Caps Lock started working


test: added echo line to the following files:
      .xprofile(read)
      .xsessionrc(read)
      .xinputrc(read)
      .xsession(not read)
      .xinitrc(not read)
  then the first 3 files were read.

test2: made the 3 files output stderr to file:
  -> got no error message.

conclusion: 3 files are read, and the xmodmap command is executed, but the keymap setting is changed by something.
