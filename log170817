1. Brew couldn't link MySQL
Changed the directory permission. Successed.

2. Execute MySQL statement from text file
mysql> source file_name

3. Using CodeIgniter, got the error: "Class 'Controller' not found."
Found the answer in stack overflow:
   In CodeIgniter 2 your controllers inherit from super class CI_Controller, rather than the super class Controller used in CodeIgniter 1.
   The same applies to models in CI2 which extend the class CI_Model rather then Model.

4. Error: "Undefined method CI_Controller::CI_Controller()."
In PHP5, constructor must be written as
  CI_Controller::__construct()

5. Error: mysqli::real_connect(): (HY000/2002): No such file or directory
'hostname' => 'localhost'
-> 'hostname' => '127.0.0.1'
