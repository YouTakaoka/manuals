[couldn't run java program on eclim]
error message:
  java.lang.RuntimeException: Required setting 'org.eclim.java.run.mainclass' has not been set.

solution:

1. Teach eclim name of Main class (class contains main() method)
  Save the file, run :ProjectSettings command which will open the mentioned file and set:
    org.eclim.java.run.mainclass=Main
  Don't forget to save that one too. Now you should normally run :Java

2. Write main() method properly. Don't omit the argument:
  public static void main(String[] args){...

error message2:
  Can't find Main class or load it.

solution:
  Recreate the project.
