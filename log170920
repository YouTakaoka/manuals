Installed apache and tomcat on centos6(local).

[Cannot access controllers of CodeIgniter]
.htaccess had not been enabled.
Edit httpd.conf file as:
  AllowOverride None
                  -> All

[Tomcat doesn't work]
- Try curl command:
	curl localhost:8080
- Something's gone wrong with w3m. Do not use it.
- Alternative: lynx
