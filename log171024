[Installing Gentoo on Laptop (dual boot with Linux Mint)]

<Download iso image>
I chose livedvd-amd64-multilib-20160704.iso
(Minimal CD doesn't work for UEFI system)

<Verify signatures>
In this page:
  https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/signatures/
one can find three public keys.
The last one hit.
If you're not sure, you can try all the keys.

<Write iso image to USB strage device>
1. Unmount UBS strage device.
2. sudo dd if=livedvd-amd64-multilib-20160704.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=512k

<Boot Gentoo Linux from USB strage device>
If you see the messege:
  "secure boot violation" "invalid signature detected"

- Disable secure boot
- Choose USB device from legacy options

<Configure network>
1. Use ifconfig command to find network interface.
[In the case of wired network, its name is usually "eth0".
In the case of wireless network, it usually starts from "wl", such as "wlp1s0".]
2. Configure the interface (in this case, wlp1s0) by using ifconfig and route command:
  ifconfig eth0 ${IP_ADDR} broadcast ${BROADCAST} netmask ${NETMASK} up
  route add default gw ${GATEWAY}
In this case, the following parameters are used:
  ip: 192.168.100.5
  net mask: 255.255.255.0
  broadcast:192.168.100.255
  gateway: 192.168.100.1
3. edit /etc/resolv.conf:
  nameserver ${NAMESERVER1}
 I used the address of gateway(192.168.100.1) as the nameserver address.
4. If not yet connected, connect from GUI.
