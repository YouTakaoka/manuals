[Producing beep sound]
- Install `beep` command and invoke it.
- (another way) Invoke `echo $'\a'`.

*On my laptop PC, the methods written above didn't work.
 Maybe the device doesn't exist or is broken.

[Catching the exit status of the previous command in a shellscript]
- It's impossible. All the attempts I made ware the waste of time.

[Notice when using `if` syntax to make condition branching by the value of `$?`]
- The `test` command itself has its own exit status, so it changes the value of `$?` variable when it is used.
- So, DO NOT USE `$?` directly when using `if` syntax.
- Make sure to copy the value of `$?` to the another variable, say `$ret`, and use the new variable in the `if` condition branching.

[Made a new program "chime"]
- I made a new bash shellscript "chime", which is a tool admits some shell commands and produces some sounds depends on the exit staus of the input command.
